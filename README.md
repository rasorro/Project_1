## Installation & Setup

### **0. Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/rasorro/Project_1.git
    cd Project_1
    ```
    - Your command may be different, check you're able to pull and push before you start working to save a headache at the end. Setting up an ssh key so I could push and commit took a while for me to figure out.

### **1. Create a Virtual Environment (only done once)**
```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
```

### **2. Activate the Virtual Environment (do every time you start working on project)**
- On **macOS/Linux**:
    ```sh
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
- On **Windows**
    ```sh
    .venv\scripts\activate
    ```
### **3. Install Dependencies**
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Useful Info

### If you install a new package, update 'requirements.txt':
```sh
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application
```sh
flask --app flaskr run
